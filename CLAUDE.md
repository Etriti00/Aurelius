### 4. Architecture

#### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 beta
- **API Client**: SWR for data fetching
- **Real-time**: Socket.io client for WebSocket connections
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with React Three Fiber for brain visualization
- **Build Tool**: Turbo for faster builds
- **Code Quality**: ESLint (strict), Prettier, Husky

#### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: NestJS with modular architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for AI embeddings
- **ORM**: Prisma with type-safe database access
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and Bull queue management
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport strategies (Google, Microsoft OAuth)
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 via AI Gateway module
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections
- **Background Jobs**: Bull queue for async task processing
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI at `/api/docs`

#### Key Architectural Patterns
1. **Modular Structure**: Backend uses NestJS modules for separation of concerns
2. **Shared UI Components**: Frontend has centralized UI at `frontend/src/components/ui/`
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict checking throughout
4. **TASA Loop**: Trigger → Analysis → Suggestion → Action (proactivity engine)
5. **Caching Strategy**: Redis with decorators for frequently accessed data
6. **Authentication Flow**: OAuth providers + JWT for session management

### 7. AI Cost Optimization Strategy

**We use ONLY Claude-4-sonnet** for all AI operations (~$0.013/action)

**Cost Optimization through Intelligent Caching**:
- **Response Caching**: Cache all AI responses in Redis for 48-72 hours
- **Semantic Deduplication**: Use vector similarity to identify similar requests
- **Request Batching**: Combine multiple small requests into single API calls
- **Smart Invalidation**: Only refresh cache when underlying data changes
- **Preemptive Caching**: Cache common queries during off-peak hours
- **User Pattern Learning**: Cache based on individual user patterns

**Redis Caching Implementation**:
```typescript
// Cache layers with different TTLs
- Session Cache: 24h (user sessions, OAuth tokens)
- AI Response Cache: 48-72h (Claude responses)
- Computed Results: 7 days (complex analyses)
- Vector Search Results: 24h (semantic queries)
```

**Background Processing**:
- Use Bull queues for non-urgent AI tasks
- Batch process during low-usage periods
- Aggregate similar requests across users

### 8. Development Standards & Problem-Solving

**Code Quality Standards**:
- **NEVER introduce bugs** - Test thoroughly before committing
- **Fix bugs immediately** when discovered, even if unrelated to current task
- **NO hallucination** - Never make up information or lie to speed up development
- **Always verify** - Check documentation and existing code before implementing
- **Responsive design** - Every feature must work perfectly across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)

**Problem-Solving Methodology - "CEO and Board of Directors"**:
When facing complex challenges:
1. **Search codebase memory** - Understand existing patterns and implementations
2. **Multiple perspectives** - Consider the problem from different angles:
   - **CEO**: Strategic impact and business value
   - **CTO**: Technical feasibility and architecture
   - **Security Officer**: Security and privacy implications
   - **UX Designer**: User experience and accessibility
   - **DevOps**: Deployment and maintenance considerations
3. **Synthesize** - Combine perspectives to find the optimal solution
4. **Document decision** - Explain why this approach was chosen

**Example of multi-perspective thinking**:
```typescript
// Problem: Implementing rate limiting
// CEO: Protects business from abuse, ensures fair usage
// CTO: Redis-based with sliding window algorithm
// Security: Prevents DDoS, brute force attacks
// UX: Graceful degradation with clear user feedback
// DevOps: Configurable limits via environment variables
// Solution: Implement with all perspectives considered
```

### 9. Current UI/UX (Preserve Existing)

**Landing Page**: 
- Apple-inspired light theme with glassmorphism
- Feature cards with `backdrop-blur-xl bg-white/60`

- Current component library at `frontend/src/components/ui/`

**Responsive Requirements**:
- Mobile-first approach (320px minimum)
- Tablet optimization (768px breakpoint)
- Desktop enhancement (1024px+)
- Test on all major browsers and devices
- Ensure touch-friendly interactions

### 10. Security Implementation

- **Encryption**: AES-256 for tokens, TLS 1.3 for transport

### 15. Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Preserve existing UI/UX** - Don't change current component structure
2. **Use npm** - Not pnpm or yarn
3. **Monorepo structure** - Frontend and backend in single repo
4. **Never use localStorage/sessionStorage** - Use React state only
5. **Encrypt all sensitive data at rest** - Especially OAuth tokens
6. **Track AI usage meticulously** - Every action costs money
7. **"Wise Advisor" tone** - In all user-facing text
8. **Mobile-responsive** - Current design must work on all devices
9. **WebSocket real-time updates** - Maintain existing Socket.io setup
10. **Three.js brain visualization** - Keep existing 3D FAB implementation

### 16. Performance Targets

- **API Response**: <200ms for most endpoints
- **Frontend Bundle**: Optimize with Turbo
- **Lighthouse Score**: >90 (current target)
- **WebSocket Latency**: <100ms
- **Database Queries**: Use Prisma's query optimization
- **Mobile Performance**: 60fps animations, <3s initial load

### 17. Deployment

- **Frontend**: Vercel (Next.js optimized)
- **Backend**: Railway (NestJS + PostgreSQL + Redis)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking
- **Analytics**: Consider Mixpanel for user behavior

When unclear about requirements, ask clarifying questions. Always maintain the existing codebase structure and UI/UX. Search the codebase for context before implementing new features. Use the "CEO and Board of Directors" method for complex decisions. Never hallucinate or create bugs - quality over speed.

You are enhancing an already functional Aurelius platform. Respect existing patterns while implementing new features with excellence.
