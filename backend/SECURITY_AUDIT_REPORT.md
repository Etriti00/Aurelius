# Security Audit Report - Aurelius Backend

## Executive Summary
This security audit was conducted on the Aurelius backend codebase to identify potential security vulnerabilities. The audit covered 15 categories of security concerns including hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, authentication/authorization, and more.

## Audit Date
2025-06-24

## Overall Security Assessment
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

The codebase demonstrates good security practices in many areas but has several vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.

## Critical Findings

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK)
**Files Affected:**
- `/src/modules/search/services/vector.service.ts`
- `/src/modules/search/services/semantic-search.service.ts`

**Issue:** The vector search service uses `$queryRawUnsafe` with string concatenation for building SQL queries, which is vulnerable to SQL injection:

```typescript
// Lines 114-147 in vector.service.ts
let query = `
  SELECT 
    id,
    content,
    metadata,
    type,
    "userId",
    "createdAt",
    "updatedAt",
    1 - (embedding <=> $1::vector) as similarity
  FROM "VectorEmbedding"
  WHERE 1 - (embedding <=> $1::vector) > $2
`;

// Lines 328-362 - Direct field name interpolation
clauses.push(`"${filter.field}" = $${paramIndex}`);
```

**Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries exclusively. Never interpolate field names directly into SQL queries. Consider using a whitelist of allowed field names.

### 2. Potential Path Traversal (MEDIUM RISK)
**Files Affected:**
- `/src/common/utils/file.utils.ts`

**Issue:** While the file utilities don't directly expose path traversal vulnerabilities, they lack explicit path sanitization:

```typescript
// No path.normalize() or validation against directory traversal
static async ensureDir(dirPath: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await stat(dirPath);
  } catch (error) {
    await mkdir(dirPath, { recursive: true });
  }
}
```

**Recommendation:** Add path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks:
```typescript
const normalizedPath = path.normalize(dirPath);
if (normalizedPath.includes('..')) {
  throw new Error('Invalid path');
}
```

### 3. Weak Encryption Key Management (HIGH RISK)
**Files Affected:**
- `/src/config/security.config.ts`
- `/src/modules/security/services/encryption.service.ts`

**Issue:** The encryption service uses a hardcoded salt for master key derivation:

```typescript
// Line 24 in encryption.service.ts
this.masterKey = this.deriveKey(masterKeyString, 'aurelius-master-salt');
```

**Recommendation:** Use a randomly generated salt stored separately from the key, or use a proper key management system.

### 4. CORS Configuration Issues (MEDIUM RISK)
**Files Affected:**
- `/src/main.ts`
- `/src/modules/security/middleware/security-headers.middleware.ts`

**Issues:**
- CORS allows credentials with configurable origins
- CSP allows `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` for scripts in production
- Duplicate CORS handling in both main.ts and security middleware

**Recommendation:** 
- Remove `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` from production CSP
- Consolidate CORS configuration to one location
- Use strict origin validation

### 5. Missing Input Validation (MEDIUM RISK)
**Files Affected:** Multiple controller files

**Issue:** While DTOs are used with class-validator, some endpoints may not have comprehensive validation for all input types.

**Recommendation:** Ensure all endpoints validate:
- Request body size limits
- File upload restrictions
- Query parameter validation
- Header validation

## Moderate Findings

### 6. Session Management
**Positive:** JWT tokens have appropriate expiration times (15 minutes for access tokens).

**Issue:** No explicit session invalidation mechanism for logout.

**Recommendation:** Implement a token blacklist or use refresh token rotation.

### 7. Rate Limiting
**Positive:** Custom throttle guard implementation with user-based tracking.

**Issue:** Admin users bypass rate limiting entirely, which could be exploited if an admin account is compromised.

**Recommendation:** Implement separate, higher rate limits for admin users rather than bypassing entirely.

### 8. Security Headers
**Positive:** Comprehensive security headers implementation including CSP, HSTS, and other protective headers.

**Issues:**
- CSP allows `unsafe-inline` for styles and scripts
- Some third-party domains are whitelisted broadly

### 9. Authentication & Authorization
**Positive:** 
- OAuth integration with major providers
- JWT implementation with separate secrets for different token types
- Role-based access control

**No critical issues found.**

### 10. File Operations
**Positive:** File operations are abstracted through services with type validation.

**Recommendation:** Add file size limits and virus scanning for uploads.

## Low Risk Findings

### 11. Information Disclosure
**Positive:** Error messages are properly sanitized through exception filters.

### 12. API Security
**Positive:** 
- API versioning implemented
- Swagger documentation properly secured in production
- Global validation pipe with whitelist

### 13. Secrets Management
**Positive:** No hardcoded secrets found. All sensitive values are loaded from environment variables.

**Recommendation:** Validate that all required environment variables are set at startup (already implemented for JWT secrets).

### 14. Logging & Monitoring
**Positive:** Comprehensive logging with Winston, sensitive data sanitization in logs.

### 15. Dependencies
**Recommendation:** Regularly update dependencies and run security audits with `npm audit`.

## Recommendations Priority

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities in vector.service.ts
2. Remove hardcoded salt in encryption service
3. Remove `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` from production CSP

### Short-term Improvements:
1. Add path validation to file operations
2. Implement session invalidation mechanism
3. Consolidate CORS configuration
4. Add file upload size limits and scanning

### Long-term Enhancements:
1. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
2. Add security monitoring and alerting
3. Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
4. Regular penetration testing

## Positive Security Features

The codebase demonstrates several security best practices:
- Comprehensive authentication system with OAuth
- Proper secret management through environment variables
- Global validation and sanitization
- Security headers implementation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Encryption service for sensitive data

## Conclusion

While the Aurelius backend has a solid security foundation, the SQL injection vulnerabilities and encryption key management issues pose significant risks that should be addressed immediately. The development team has implemented many security best practices, but the identified vulnerabilities could potentially compromise the system's security.

**Overall Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM - The application has good security practices but contains vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Recommendation:** Address the critical findings immediately, particularly the SQL injection vulnerabilities, before deploying to production.
